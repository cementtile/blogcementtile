<div style="text-align: justify">Like ceramic tiles, porcelain tiles are available in a wide variety of styles, designs, and patterns. However, unlike their ceramic counterparts, their color and pattern extend beyond their surface and through their full thickness. Natural stone tiles made from granite, marble, slate, travertine, and so forth are another option. While they are hard-wearing and have grown in popularity in recent years, they also represent the most expensive bathroom flooring option.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">On top of that, natural stone bathroom floor tiles are porous. This means that, if not correctly sealed before use, they are prone to water and they stain easily. However, they should not be cleaned with bleaches or strong chemicals as they can potentially damage them.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Although carpet has traditionally been a favourite living room flooring choice, today hard surface materials such as wood, rigid LVT, and laminate are often the preferred choice. These flooring materials are all much easier to clean and maintain than carpet, and more resistant to stains.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">A Flooring Installer or Flooring Contractor installs different types of flooring and floor covering in both residential and commercial buildings. They work with different product types including carpeting, vinyl and tile.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Cement tiles are not difficult to maintain. Once they have been sealed correctly, the surface can be cleaned with products that are suitable for use on natural stone. Household cleaners such as Simple Green or specialty products like Miracle Tile & Stone Cleaner have shown good results.
Terracotta, Italian marble, and porcelain tiles seem to be the preferred choice these days. The designer and textured marble is best suited for large and spacious living rooms, whereas a small living room can be decorated with cement tiles.</div>
