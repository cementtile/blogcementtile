<div style="text-align: justify">Home renovators on tight budgets should consider painting their existing tiles. With several high-quality anti-bacterial, water-resistant epoxy paints on the market, this a great way to drag outdated bathroom floors (that are otherwise in good condition) into the present. A note of caution though: DIY tile painting jobs can take up to a week in total and poor work can result in peeling of chipping paint jobs.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Because of the absorbent quality, the surface of the tiles needs to be kept as clean as possible during installation. An experienced tiler would use a damp sponge to wipe away materials as they are working. Also, just as important is what happens beneath the tiles. A flexible adhesive needs to be used and applied evenly to the substrate using a wide notched trowel. They also need to be gently pressed down and not hammered as this could cause micro-cracks.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Encaustic cement tiles or cement tiles are completely handmade. They are made of concrete and the color in the pattern comes from mineral pigments which are mixed and poured into a mold. … The pattern is not painted and glazed like most decorative ceramic tiles. Encaustic cement tiles are considered a “green product” because the tiles are not fired in a kiln and may feature locally sourced products in the manufacturing process. The tiles are perfect for both indoor and outdoor spaces not subject to hard freezes. The tiles are durable and best of all, they are completely customizable.</div>
Terracotta, Italian marble, and porcelain tiles seem to be the preferred choice these days. The designer and textured marble is best suited for large and spacious living rooms, whereas a small living room can be decorated with cement tiles.
