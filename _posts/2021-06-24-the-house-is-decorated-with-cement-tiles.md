<div style="text-align: justify">Encaustic cement tiles or cement tiles are completely handmade. They are made of concrete and the color in the pattern comes from mineral pigments which are mixed and poured into a mold. … The pattern is not painted and glazed like most decorative ceramic tiles. Encaustic cement tiles are considered a “green product” because the tiles are not fired in a kiln and may feature locally sourced products in the manufacturing process. The tiles are perfect for both indoor and outdoor spaces not subject to hard freezes. The tiles are durable and best of all, they are completely customizable.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Though they’ve been around for hundreds of years, cement tiles have become super trendy again in the design world. The process for making these tiles is no joke: Pigmented cement is hand poured into molds (similar to cookie cutters), molds are removed, then the tiles are compressed under 2,000 pounds of pressure. Cement tiles are available in a ton of different colors, patterns and sizes, though 8×8 tiles are probably the most common.</div>

If you want to change the look of a room, change the floors. Flooring can make your space look instantly cooler, warmer, larger, smaller, more intimate, cozier and more luxe.
Deciding to start your own construction company can be an exciting, but overwhelming experience. With so much research, reporting, and paperwork to complete, it’s easy to get lost in the administrative details and forget the passion that inspired you to start your own business to begin with.</div>
