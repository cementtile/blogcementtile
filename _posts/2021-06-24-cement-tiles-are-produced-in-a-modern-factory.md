The color is mixed in a horizontal mixer to blend the mixture. Water is added to the color mixture and hand poured into the different sections of the mold that creates the pattern.  If no pattern is required, the same color is used for the entire color layer and no pattern mold is required. The thickness of the color layer will always be between 3 and 5 millimeters (about 5/8″ thick).</div>

They are made of concrete and the color in the pattern comes from mineral pigments which are mixed and poured into a mold. This method was developed in the mid-19th century and hasn’t changed much since then. The pattern is not painted and glazed like most decorative ceramic tiles.  The pattern is inlaid into the body of the tile using a mold.</div>

Even when exposed to harsh sunlight, the tile colours do not fade away. This colure permanence feature also makes it an optimal choice.
It appears the Ancient Greeks were the first civilization to create decorative mosaics by embedding small stones into beds of mud or mortar. Ancient Greeks were also the first to use marble as a flooring material.</div>
