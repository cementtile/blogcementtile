Though in recent years the bathroom flooring choices have expanded and now include stamped concrete, hardwood, bamboo, and even cork, bathroom floor tiles are still the most popular option in Australia. So, what are the choices when it comes to cement tile bathrooms? What types of tiles are available, what are they made from, what colors and styles are on-trend, and – most importantly – how should homeowners and specifiers go about choosing the best bathroom tiles for their home or project?

Cement tiles are not difficult to maintain. Once they have been sealed correctly, the surface can be cleaned with products that are suitable for use on natural stone. Household cleaners such as Simple Green or specialty products like Miracle Tile & Stone Cleaner have shown good results.
Terracotta, Italian marble, and porcelain tiles seem to be the preferred choice these days. The designer and textured marble is best suited for large and spacious living rooms, whereas a small living room can be decorated with cement tiles.
If you’re focused solely on initial cost, building a house can be a bit cheaper — around $7,000 less — than buying one, especially if you take some steps to lower the construction costs and don’t include any custom finishes
