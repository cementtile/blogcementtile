[Cement tiles](nguyensoncavn.com) or hydraulic tiles are handmade colorful tiles used as floor and wall tiling. They appeared in Catalonia (Spain) in the 1850s, and have been widely used in Europe and America. They represented a revolution in flooring in their day because they were much cheaper, more durable and easier to make than the previous handmade glazed ceramic tiles and were, therefore, more universally available for houses, and they allowed for profuse decorative patterns, their age of splendour being the end of the 19th to the middle of the 20th centuries before they were gradually superseded by newer technologies as of the 1960s, such as terrazzo, salt-glazed stoneware, etc. that did not allow for such decorative embellishment but were cheaper.

<div style="text-align: justify"><div style="text-align: justify">Construction involves designing and building the ‘built’ environment around us: not only skyscrapers, football stadiums and bridges, but also houses, factories, hospitals, schools, railways, tunnels, piers, dams, coastal defences and energy generation plants.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Encaustic tiles are those beautiful cement tiles (often patterned) you may have seen on Instagram, Pinterest, or other design sites. While they are a gorgeous option — not only for their looks but the way they feel softer underfoot too — they do require more maintenance and care than regular ceramic or porcelain tiles. Because of the way these tiles are manufactured and their porous material, it’s important to take care when installing them, as well as ongoing cleaning and maintenance. I have encaustic tiles in my home and struggled to find good information online on how to care for encaustic cement tiles so I hope this article helps others who have or are considering using these tiles.</div>
