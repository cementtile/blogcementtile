<div style="text-align: justify">Construction involves designing and building the ‘built’ environment around us: not only skyscrapers, football stadiums and bridges, but also houses, factories, hospitals, schools, railways, tunnels, piers, dams, coastal defences and energy generation plants.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Drawing inspiration from aged cement tiles, the SomerTile Asturias Perla Marbella 13-1/8 in. x 13-1/8 in. Ceramic Floor and Wall Tile brings a subdued encaustic look to your space. Featuring an old-world pattern in muted brown, grey and blue tones, this Spanish tile offers an authentic, worn feel. With a slightly textured matte glaze, these tiles have a distressed, weathered look including slight chemical-splashed spotting and sporadic splashes of glossy glazing which reflect light. The speckled coloring throughout each tile mimics the appearan Products.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Because of the absorbent quality, the surface of the tiles needs to be kept as clean as possible during installation. An experienced tiler would use a damp sponge to wipe away materials as they are working. Also, just as important is what happens beneath the tiles. A flexible adhesive needs to be used and applied evenly to the substrate using a wide notched trowel. They also need to be gently pressed down and not hammered as this could cause micro-cracks.</div>
