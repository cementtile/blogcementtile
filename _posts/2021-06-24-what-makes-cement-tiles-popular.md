<div style="text-align: justify">Encaustic cement tiles or cement tiles are completely handmade.  They are made of concrete and the color in the pattern comes from mineral pigments which are mixed and poured into a mold. This method was developed in the mid-19th century and hasn’t changed much since then. The pattern is not painted and glazed like most decorative ceramic tiles.  The pattern is inlaid into the body of the tile using a mold.</div>

[Cement tiles](https://nguyensoncavn.com/) or hydraulic tiles are handmade colorful tiles used as floor and wall tiling. They appeared in Catalonia (Spain) in the 1850s, and have been widely used in Europe and America. They represented a revolution in flooring in their day because they were much cheaper, more durable and easier to make than the previous handmade glazed ceramic tiles and were, therefore, more universally available for houses, and they allowed for profuse decorative patterns, their age of splendour being the end of the 19th to the middle of the 20th centuries before they were gradually superseded by newer technologies as of the 1960s, such as terrazzo, salt-glazed stoneware, etc. that did not allow for such decorative embellishment but were cheaper.

<div style="text-align: justify">Regardless of choice, it’s important to again remember that floor tiles require higher levels of wear resistance and slip resistance than wall tiles. While its fine to run floor tiles up walls the converse is not true. Nonslip bathroom floor tiles are the only option for bathrooms.</div>
