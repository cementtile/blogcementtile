<div style="text-align: justify">A design concept is the core idea driving the design of a product, explained via a collection of sketches, images, and a written statement. This helps the designers and, later, the developers stay on track throughout the creative process, ensuring they bring a product to market with value to target users.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">A creative concept is an overarching “Big Idea” that captures audience interest, influences their emotional response and inspires them to take action. It is a unifying theme that can be used across all campaign messages, calls to action, communication channels and audiences.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Like ceramic tiles, porcelain tiles are available in a wide variety of styles, designs, and patterns. However, unlike their ceramic counterparts, their color and pattern extend beyond their surface and through their full thickness. Natural stone tiles made from granite, marble, slate, travertine, and so forth are another option. While they are hard-wearing and have grown in popularity in recent years, they also represent the most expensive bathroom flooring option.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Still, the earthy beauty associated with these bathroom tiles along with the fact that no two tiles are alike has seen them gain a healthy following. As long as they are well maintained and sealed periodically, they can handle wet areas without a problem. Even though they cost more than cheap bathroom floor tiles, they are worth considering.</div>
